Subject: Bribe your friends to help spread your pledge.

Hello again,

At <?=$values['pledgebank_site_name']?> we're always keen to help people make their pledges
succeed. We've calculated that unless you do something then your
pledge isn't going to grow fast enough to get the number of people it
needs.

We have a suggestion though - bribe your friends with food!

Write an email right now and tell 5 or 6 people you know really well
that you'll make them a slap up meal, but only if they help make your
pledge succeed.

They can help by printing our flyers from <?=$values['pledge_url_flyers']?>
or simply by sending the pledge URL to their friends - <?=$values['pledge_url']?>

Go on, if they're real friends they'll want to help!

best,

<?=$values['signature']?>
